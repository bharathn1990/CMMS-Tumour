- There are three files used to run the simulation.

1. The run.py is the main file to be run.
2. implementations.py contains all the functions that are called by run.py
3. config.py is a header type of file that contains all the general constants called by either run.py or implementations.py.

- In config.py, you can change the concentration of oxygen that we start off with.
